# WebTask
## This is the challenge for TangoCode interview

The project is divided in two folders, each one of them has it's own instructions of how to run it:

- webtask: This folder contains the frontend project created with ReactJS
- backend: This folder contains the backend project created with NodeJS

Remember to run the backend project before the frontend, because it's necesary to get the data to show in frontend.

Welcome.
